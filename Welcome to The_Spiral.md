This is a website where I share my interests. It will be a mix of technical and coding discoveries and more general rabbit holes that piqued my interest. If you love to spend hours descending into rabbit holes The Spiral is for you :)

Keep in mind that this is one of many side projects and it might take a while for me to add content. Thanks for stopping by anyway!
